My solutions to the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

### Usage

1. Open [PuzzleInputDownloader.cs](https://github.com/ryanjfitz/AdventOfCode2024/blob/master/AdventOfCode2024.Tests/PuzzleInputDownloader.cs) from the test project and provide a value for the `aocSessionCookie` constant.
2. Run `dotnet test`. Any missing puzzle inputs will be downloaded to the test project's bin folder using your session cookie. Then the unit tests will run. Note that some unit tests will fail as your puzzle inputs will differ from mine.
3. Once the puzzle inputs have been downloaded, you can revert the change from step 1.
