My solutions to the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

### Usage

From bash, run `AOC_SESSION=12345 dotnet test`, replacing `12345` with your adventofcode.com session value. Any missing puzzle inputs will be downloaded to the test project's bin folder. Then the unit tests will run. Note that some unit tests will fail as your puzzle inputs will differ from mine. Once the puzzle inputs have been downloaded, you can simply run `dotnet test` for subsequent runs.
